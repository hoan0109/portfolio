# **Welcome to my Web Portfolio**

Hello and welcome to my Web Portfolio for MTM6201_010 Web Development II. My name is Joseph Hoang and I am currently an 18 years old student in the Interactive Media Design (IMD) program at Algonquin College. I made this portfolio not only for the purpose of the assignment but also to showcase my knowledge from the Web Development course over the past year of HTML, CSS and other skills.

The purpose of my portfolio is mostly to showcase my design and photography skills, so it obviously has to be visually appealing. The homepage is just a title page with a large image to instantly grab the viewers attention. I made this by having the image set as a background image. The about page features a photo of me, a short bio, and a few of my skills. The portfolio page features some work that I have completed in my previous classes like Web Development, Digital Graphics and Photography. My last page, the contact page is where users can get in contact with me.

My biggest challenge in this assignment is creating responsive images. Bringing them over to Adobe Photoshop and setting screen size for all browsers sizes. It's something I haven't fully understood yet and still learning.

Some resources I used are:

-W3Schools
-validator.w3.org
-jigsaw.w3.org
-google fonts

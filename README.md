# **Welcome to my Web Portfolio**

Hello and welcome to my Web Portfolio for MTM6201_010 Web Development II. My name is Joseph Hoang and I am currently an 18 years old student in the Interactive Media Design (IMD) program at Algonquin College. I made this portfolio not only for the purpose of the assignment but also to showcase my knowledge from the Web Development course over the past year of HTML, CSS and other skills.

The purpose for my portfolio is mostly to showcase my design and photography skills so it obviously has to be visually appealing. The homepage is just a title page with a large image for grab the viewers attention. I made this by having the image set as a background image.
